Hey! The name's Jim, I'm what could be defined as an "engineer in training".

Let's start with the WARNINGS: THIS PROJECT IS MADE FOR RECREATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY. I CANNOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE THIS CODE MAY CAUSE TO YOU OR YOUR BOARDS.

Ok, now that I'm free of anything, let me tell you about this project: this is inspired by the gorgeous work of Crashworks3D, so if you want a working code for arduino head to their github and RUN AWAY from here, as this is a code made because I woke up and decided to do it.

Important note: because this is still an experiment, I still haven't figured out how to make it usable through Arduino IDE, so you'll need to clone this in VS Code.

It has some basic features to motorize an Iron Man helmet using two MG90s (of any brand, you can modify the PWM values in the code's CONFIGURATION tab), two leds and a momentary push button like the limit switches used in 3D printers.

In the configuration.h tab you can play around with different customizations either if you want the eyes to behave differently, the servos to have different values or you're not using a J.I.M. board that I gave you myself and you wanna change some pins.

That's basically everything, I'll update if there's something important you'll have to know. EnJoy! And remember, USE THIS CODE ONLY IF YOU'RE FEARLESS OR DESPERATE.

Jim
